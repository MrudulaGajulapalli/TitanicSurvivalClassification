# TitanicSurvivalClassification

##Overview
This project aims to predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Even after more than a century, this tragic event continues to captivate public interest, and the dataset provides a glimpse into the lives of passengers onboard.

##Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available from Kaggle and includes information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. This dataset is split into training and test sets, allowing for supervised learning techniques to be applied.

##Objectives
Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
Explore the dataset to understand correlations and patterns in the data that might influence survival rates.
Implement various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc., and compare their performance.
Fine-tune the model for better performance using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
##Tools and Libraries
Python: Programming language used for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical operations on data.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building models.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization libraries to explore insights from the data.
##Deliverables
Jupyter Notebook detailing the data analysis and machine learning model implementation.
Extend the analysis to include more advanced feature engineering techniques.
Explore ensemble methods or deep learning approaches for potentially improved accuracy.
Deploy the model as a web application or integrate it into a larger data pipeline.
##Conclusion
By completing this project, we aim to not only predict survival on the Titanic accurately but also gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates during this historic event.
